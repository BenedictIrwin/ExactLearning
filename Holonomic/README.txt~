Adaptation for holonomic functions in general... 

We assume the function being modelled follows

P_n(x) f^(n)(x) + ... + P_0(x) f(x) = 0 i.e. Annihilation operator.. with
derivatives..

The Mellin transform is then

P_n(s) phi(s-n) + ... P_0(s) phi(s) + ... + P_k(s) phi(s+k) = 0 

We write as a matrix equation

[phi(s-n) ... phi(s) ... phi(k)] . M . [1 s s^2 s^3 ...]

And solve numerically for M? That is we can numerically get a bunch of phi
from the distribution, then we can just try to solve for M that is consistent
over a bunch of S values... 

Example:

[phi(s-1) phi(s)][[1,-1],[1,0]][1,s] = 0 Which is Exp[-x] -> Gamma[s]
