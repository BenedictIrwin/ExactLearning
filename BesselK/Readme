This directory has the files for attempting to fit a BesselK[0,x] function. 
The problem with this is that there is an infinity at x=0, so this is not a distribution, but it has nice moments in terms of gamam functions
I.e. 2^(s-2)Gamma[s/2]^2 

The output is (subject to random): 

[1.51428095 0.32285122 0.44921704 2.13583531]

The ideal parameter vector is [sqrt(2),1/2,1/2,2] fdor the exact moments. The output is [1.5,0.32,0.45,2.1] which is close.
