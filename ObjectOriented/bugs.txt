Clearly bugs:

trigamma nan bug on using linear-gamma with L-BFGS-b

Getting wrong answers, because not prioritising simpler expressions...

When sympy crashes, it kills everything, we need more try except. 
If the Inverse Mellin Transform or normalisation files, then just abort that fingerprint, or divert to a moments only solution


Features:

We might prefer floats rather than huge fractions like 8720979037792035/10000000000000 etc.
Possibly a setting for that?

Auto-flush the Functions folder.

Remember to analyse the support of the moments?
This can be done when fitting a MomentsBundle?
