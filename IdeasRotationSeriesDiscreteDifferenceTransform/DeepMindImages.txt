There were lots of examples of images in which motifs were recognised by deep learning, then the wieghts could be cranked up to generate a picture full of cats, hats etc.
Very wacky.

But if a deep network was trained to recognise chemical groups. What would happen if the resulting wieghts were tweaked?
Would it be able to generate molecules with extra motifs?
