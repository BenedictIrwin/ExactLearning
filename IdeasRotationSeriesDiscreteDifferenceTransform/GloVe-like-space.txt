GloVe is an embedding for words.
The distances between words in the resulting space is meaningful.

For example the separation between queen and woman and king and man will retain a notion of gender.

The iea is can we extend that to molecules, either by the fingeprint of DIRECTLY by the SMILES string.
Reccurent neural networks can handle brackets.

Matt thinks IBM are working on some kind of druglike molecule generation via strings.

Could train on CHEMBL and see what the molecular space looks like. For example similar backbones having the same fragment either present or not.
