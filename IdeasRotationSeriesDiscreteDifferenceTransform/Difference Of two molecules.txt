If we take two molecules A and B, these can be enumerated using the same set of descriptors

If we take the diffeence of each set of descriptors, we will end up with positive and negative descriptor values.
If we find the molecule closest to these descriptor values in a much large set, then we can write the difference of two molecules A and B as the difference of another two molecules B and C
where C is the positive values only and D is the negative values only.

What will this look like?
