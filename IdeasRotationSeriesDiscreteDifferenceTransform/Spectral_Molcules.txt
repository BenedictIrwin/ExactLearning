Molecules are objects in the real space.

Often there is great interpretation in the spectrum of a real quantity. I.e. the complemntary function for a disitribution etc.
These exist through the Fourier transform, or some other transform.

Is there a wel ldefined notion of the spectrum of a molecule? What properties does it have and are some of them easier to access in this space?
Is this useful for further methods?
