Here we have a mini-project to 'learn' the n=4 wavefunction for the time-independant schrodinger equation.
We first solve the equation numerically (of course the solutions are known, but we pretend we do not know them)
Next we numerically integrate the complex moments of the numeric solution
We transport these complex moments to the exact learning script

The script uses BFGS to fit a 7 parameter form to the log-moments and the loss comes out at around 1e-9 showing a great fit.
The fitted parameters have very clear structure that translates directly into mathematical understanding of the solution, 
for example the prescence of a term gamma(1/2 + s/2).

In this solution we had to introduce a polynomial alongside the generalised form shown in the paper, which adds additional flexibility.
This is only a second order polynomial and it uses 3 of the 7 coefficients.
